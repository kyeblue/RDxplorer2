Reads lower than the threshold this will be ignored.\r\n4. a quality score threshold for sampling the insert template length distribution.  \r\nReads lower than the threshold will be ignored\r\n\r\nTo run the script:\r\n* If you have a list of precomputed events:\r\n```bash\r\nrunReadExtractor.sh input.bam summary.txt 32 60\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you have a preexisting folder containing the .sum files generated from **event finding**:\r\n```bash\r\nrunReadExtractor.sh input.bam resultFolder 32 60\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you have just run **event finding** and are still in the same directory:\r\n```bash\r\nrunReadExtractor.sh input.bam . 32 60\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output will be a newly created folder called \"pairedReads\" placed in the current directory.  \r\n\r\nInside are \"delEvents.txt\" and \"dupEvents.txt\" with tab delimited columns:\r\n* cols 1  : a unique identifier for the event\r\n* cols 2-4: the 4 columns of interest.\r\n* cols 5- : the original summary info.\r\n\r\nThere are 24 paired reads files, \"dels\\_\\*.pr\", and \"dups\\_\\*.pr\", split by chromosome.\r\nEach .pr has the reads' mapping info along with a column showing the event they are from. \r\n\r\nThere is an insert template length distribution file, \"insDistr.txt\".  \r\nThis is a sampling of ~50k template lengths from high quality read pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Event Validation**\r\n\r\nThe program assumes there is a properly constructed \"pairedReads\" folder in the current directory.\r\nIf you have run the previous command, the folder will be loaded with all the necessary files.\r\n\r\nTo run the script:\r\n```bash\r\n  runEventValidator.sh\r\n```\r\nIt will write the event calls into the pairedReads folder.\r\n\r\ntodo:  add description of del/dup call files.\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n---------\r\n* Kenny Ye <kyeblue@gmail.com>\r\n* Chris Yoon <mgflute@gmail.com>\r\n* Kith Pradhan <kpradhan@cshl.edu>\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---------\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
